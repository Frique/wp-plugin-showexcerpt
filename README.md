WP Plugin: Show Excerpt
=====================

Extremely basic plugin to add an [excerpt] shortcode that will print out the Excerpt (if it exists), wrapped in predefined (plugin options) "before" and "after" stuff.

This will prevent repetition (copy part of an article to the excerpt box and vice versa) and allows to define default styling around your excerpt without letting the theme load it in a default location. Think [article intro], [excerpt], [article continued].
